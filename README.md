My idea was to make a website where a user can add reviews to games that have been added by other users so my first ERD looked like this.

I then realised that the relationship between games and reviews was incorrect for what i was trying to achieve as I wanted each user to be able to add as many reviews they want to as many games as they want so updated my ERD to this.

I then came to the realisation that having a users table was out of scope for this particular project as it would take too long to implement a user login, I also wouldnt be awarded extra marks for a login feature so decided it would be a better idea for me to spend time on other parts of the project and updated the ERD accordingly.
